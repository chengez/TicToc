RULE = " Note that the environment may be dynamic. Be aware of the time elapsed. Depending on the scenario and how much time has passed, whether it's preferable to call a tool or not can vary.\nFor example, suppose you were a ski resort snow reporter with access to a tool that retrieves the current snow depth and which trails are open at the resort. If it has been only a few minutes since your last retrieval when a user asks about the snow, it's unlikely that the status has changedâ€”so it's better not to call the tool again. However, if hours or even days have passed, then it's clearly better to call the tool again to retrieve the latest information.\nAs another example, suppose you were an agent checking immigration or visa processing cases for users, and you have access to a tool that retrieves stage updates from a government agency on active cases. If it has been only a few minutes since you last checked when a user asks for an update, it's very unlikely the status has changed, so calling the tool again isn't necessary. But if more than a day has passed since the previous check, then it's clearly better to query the tool again to get the most up-to-date information."
